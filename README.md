# Top 10 Restaurants Finder â€“ Python Script

## Project Overview

This Python script allows users to fetch the **top 10 restaurants in any city** using Google search results via **SerpAPI**. It collects key restaurant details such as:

- Restaurant name  
- Google rating  
- Number of reviews  
- Address  

The script sorts restaurants based on **rating** and **review count** to ensure quality results, then saves the data to a structured JSON file named `top_restaurants.json`.
